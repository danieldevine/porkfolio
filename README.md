This is just a side-scrolling full page slide WordPress theme, using superslides.js
It also features a 'CV' slide which is run by custom post types. Its ultra-specific to my own site right now, but I'm interested in developing this into something more broadly useful.
See [todo.txt](https://github.com/danieldevine/porkfolio/blob/master/todo.txt) for a blithe underestimation of what needs to be done.

Please read the attached [dire warning](https://github.com/danieldevine/porkfolio/blob/master/DIRE-WARNING.md) and act accordingly.

##Build
Build with Grunt and Sass.

##Warning

Please also read the attached [dire warning](https://github.com/danieldevine/porkfolio/blob/master/DIRE-WARNING.md).

If you install this theme on your WP site, there's a very strong chance that your site, your hard drive and you will wake up in a field hundreds of miles away with no pants. You have been warned.
This WordPress theme doesn't support blogging....yes I know.
I doubt this will be of much use to anyone else in its current state.
this theme is in development, with a very long TODO list.
This is not intended or recommended for use on client websites as a lot of the content is meshed with the theme in a client unfriendly way.
