It also features a 'CV' slide which is run by custom post types.

##Build
Build with Grunt and Sass.For more info on how:

###Dependencies
Needs Gravity forms, ACF v4 and the ACF gallery plug in at the moment.
(TODO: write up the extra meta fields myself, use an alternative to Gravity.)

##Warning
This WordPress theme doesn't support blogging....yes I know.
I doubt this will be of much use to anyone else in its current state.
this theme is in development, with a very long TODO list.
This is not intended or recommended for use on client websites as a lot of the content is meshed with the theme in a way that wouldn't be practical for a client to maintain (but is easier for me).
