##warning
This WordPress theme doesn't support blogging....yes I know.
I doubt this will be of much use to anyone else in its current state. 
this theme is in development, with a very long TODO list. 
This is not intended or recommended for use on client websites as a lot of the content is meshed with the theme in a way that wouldn't be practical for a client to maintain (but is easier for me).
